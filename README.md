# Postidea

Postidea helps teams run great ideation discussions remotely.

## Features

### Run Retros Remotely
Postidea lets you run an ideation discussion even when your team is distributed across the world. Your ideas will live update across all your devices so each participant can follow along on their device.

### Run Idea board
You can create idea boards for your team that are password protected or choose to leave them public so that anyone you give the link to can access them.

### Mobile Friendly
Participants can add and vote on ideas from their mobile devices, so it is easy to run a ideation without everyone in the group having a laptop nearby. This works well for retros where some people are in the room and some are remote.
